		<h1>Layered Subject Portrait</h1>
			<center><p><font size =4> My subject for my layer project was my dad Phil jeske. My dad is into a lot of things but 

			one of his favorite things is black and white photography. Because of this I decided to make all 

			the images in my project black and white to express his passion for black and white 

			photography. I also chose to do black and white because it made the whole project itself easier 

			to look at because when all the images are different colors it gets kind of crazy. I also 

			incorporated the twin towers because that is the historical moment that my dad mentioned in the 

			interview. To show which images are important I used size mostly to show which ones I wanted 

			the viewer to notice the most. For example I made the camera in the bottom right corner larger 

			because my Dad really loves cameras and photography. I also made the background a wooden 

			cabinet that my dad painted because my dad is a painter, and to compliment that I also added a 

			paint bucket and paint brushes. However I did not make these images the center of attention 

			because my Dad does not identify as a painter but it is only a tiny part of himself.

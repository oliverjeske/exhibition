	<p><center><font color="white"><font size=6>Coding the Past is a project that was based on using skills from Yearbook, Computer Science, and History. Our task for History was to interview a family member (I interviewed my Dad) and then transcribe the interview onto a document. Our task for Yearbook was to create a portait of our interviewee (my Dad) using adobe photoshop and illustrate a picture that has to do with what your interviewee likes or enjoys. Lastly, our task for computer science was to create this very website you are on. ENJOY!<font></center></p>

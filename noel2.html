		<h1>City Scandal</h1>
			<center><p>Philip wakes up and heads off to the factory 
						His breaks are short and quite unsatisfactory
						His hands are tough, tough to the touch 
						His days are long and his hours are too much
						Philip works so he can help and provide 
						But phillip knows his toils are unjustified

						Along with his starvation and his days of frustration
						Philip is a slave to the american corporation
						The coins in his pockets are barely a profit
						This  life of hardship is not something he wanted

						His family came to find better lives
						But his family was bribed by the american lie
						The american dream is just propaganda
						As it turns out the city life is all but a scandall

					<h5>
					<p>Phil jeske 46 years old born in 1971</p>

					<p>When and where were you born</p>

					<p>I was born in manitowoc wisconsin in 1971 may 4th</p>

					<p>Where did you grow up</p>

					<p>I grew up mostly in wisconsin i was born in wisconsin but then I moved to minnesota when I was three. We lived there for 4 years then moved back to wisconsin, kenosha wisconsin and I  was 7 years old and I lived there until i was twenty.</p>

					<p>Did you like growing up in wisconsin</p>

					<p>Well I liked it as much as I could because I didn’t know anything else. When I looked back at it I had a good childhood.</p>

					<p>What was your childhood like</p>
					
					<p>Well we didn't have a lot financially, alot of my friends had things I didn’t have. They had better bikes better toys, swimming pools and all that. Overall it was a pretty fun childhood. Especially with eight kids (siblings) there was a lot of goofing around and a lot of family time together. But I also found I needed to get away from my family because there was so many. Which taught me how to spend time alone. It was good. Nothing traumatic happened. No real problems in my childhood really.</p>

					<p>What is your ethnic background</p>

					<p>I am through and through german.</p>

					<p>Where is your mom's family from and where is your dad's family from</p>

					<p>I wish I knew some of this better than I do. My mom's family is in michigan north dakota and washington. There's a lot of my moms family in washington state in eastern washington. My dads family I don't really know. I know that he grew up in wisconsin. I don't know where my great grandparents lived on my dads side.</p>

					<p>Have you ever been to any of these places and what was that experience like</p>

					<p>We visited some family in north dakota and also in washington. I was only 7 years old so I don't remember it very well it's just some vague images. As far as my great grandparents they were all from germany and they moved here but I have never been to germany.</p>

					<b><p>What was the most important lesson you've learned in life and why</p>

					<p>that's really hard. I think the most important lessons i've learned are from looking back on life I don't think I earned enough lessons in the moment. But I would say the big ones would be to be honest, to work hard at what you're really good at. And I think the lesson I learned is don't wait for tomorrow for things to happen to you. Time goes by very quickly and make use of the time you have when your young and full of energy, because when your older it's hard to live with not having done all the things you did.</p>

					<p>How is your life different from what you thought you would have been like when you were younger</p>

					<p>I think I thought i would have had it figured all out by now. When i was young it always seemed like the adults knew what they were doing and they had it all figured out. And i realized when I was older that most of them don't. And I still feel like I dont have as much figured out as most adults I think I would have figured most stuff out by now.</p>

					<p>What is the most memorable moment in history for you and why </p>

					<p>I would have to say 911 because it was really a shift in the way the whole world started to think. There was kind of a safe complacency that nothing like that would happen here. And since then there has been a shift in the way we see other nations and that's translated to the way politics have shifted towards other people's view on races and religion because there were certain individuals who took advantage of the situation to say that well since this happened for religious purposes all religion must be bad and i really see the effects of that everyday. I can see the strength of that thought that really started after 911 that christianity is also a destructive and oppressive religion. It just really did shift the way the country thought about everything. I almost think about attitudes about politics, religion, and identity as being pre 911 and post 911. And it really was a traumatic day to watch our country being attacked at that kind of level was just very shocking and numbing at the time.</p></h5>
